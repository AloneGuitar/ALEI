Ever since version 10.9, ALEI has implemented small "language" to act on object parameters. Implemented by Noname(User475186).
And to those who try to use this WITHOUT having any coding background: go away, don't even try.

# Warning
I am NOT responsible for any kind of cringe you will feel reading this, Noname implemented it and I simply merged seeing its potential use.
And even then, noname implemented this thing in worst way, but w/e, better than nothing.

If you think you can do better than this, please do, I am absolutely not going to deal with this bullshittery.

# How to activate it?
First, you select objects you want to act on, then click enter, which will ask you what parameter you want to act on(It has to be XML key, so x, y, w, command... you get it), then it will ask you "script" you want to execute.

There are 5 variables you can use:<br>
p - Math PI<br>
x - Current object X<br>
y - Current object Y<br>
w - Current object W<br>
h - Current object H<br>
i - Current object ID<br>

5(+3 functions) operations:<br>
x + y - Addition <br>
x - y - Substraction<br>
x * y - Multiplication<br>
x / y - Division<br>
x ^ y - Exponentation<br>
And even functions are operation, worst design choice ever, t = theta, m = multiplier, will be 1 if you just want actual result<br>
t S m - Sine<br>
t C m - Cosine<br>
y A x - Atan2<br>
