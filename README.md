Features are listed in [features.md](/features.md)

## How to install ?
It's recommended to use [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) as that gives you benefit of auto updating. Once you download tampermonkey, you can click [here](https://github.com/ZenoABC/ALEI/raw/main/alei.user.js), then tampermonkey will ask you whether to install or not, just click "install".

You can also copy the script itself and paste in JS console & execute manually.

**NOTE:** Tampermonkey is the only natively supported userscript manager, you might have issues if you use others (Such as GreaseMonkey).
