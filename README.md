# ALE Improvements
ALEI Icon (cc: broforce1)

![ALEI Icon](/icon.png "ALEI Icon")

Script that patches ALE for the better. The goal is to make ALE more usable to map makers.

## Change History
- Makes right panel, inputs bit wider and also adds in skins that exist in-game but not in ALE. (v0.1)
- Added sounds that exist in-game but not in ALE. (v0.2), cc: wanted2001
- Renames those new sounds to names that are more friendly (e.x: `xin_hit` -> `Xin - Hurt`) (v0.5), cc: Longbow Mangudai
- Edits original stylesheet in-place, so right panel edits should work on all themes. (v0.5), thanks to Xeden and Longbow Mangudai for reporting the issue
- Forces VSync (v0.6)
- Shows 3 properties that movables have but ALE does not show. (v1.0)
- Added veh_hh to vehicle list. (v1.0), I do not know what you'd use this for, but I will add it just incase anyway
- Added missing voice presets. (v1.1), cc: wanted2001
- Added NARL and Hakase decor (v1.5)

## How to install ?
It's recommended to use [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) as that gives you benefit of auto updating. Once you download tampermonkey, you can click [here](https://github.com/ZenoABC/ALEI/raw/main/alei.user.js), then tampermonkey will ask you whether to install or not, just click "install".

You can also copy the script itself and paste in JS console & execute manually.
